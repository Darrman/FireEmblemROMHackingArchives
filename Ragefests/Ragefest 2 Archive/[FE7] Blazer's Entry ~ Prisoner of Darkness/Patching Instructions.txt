Patching Instructions
-----------------------

TYPE 1 UPS PATCH
-----------------

Note: THE PATCH IS A .UPS TYPE PATCH. YOU MUST USE NUPS TO PATCH IT.

NUPS can be found here- http://www.feshrine.net/hacking/patchers.html

1. Download and extract all files. If you're reading this, you have most likely done so already.

2. Open NUPS.

3. Select the original ROM. It is a Fire Emblem 7 (U) 1235 ROM. Do not ask where to get this.

4. Select the patch "FE - Prisoner of Darkness.ups" (or whatever is close to that in name, depending on the version--be sure to select the one with [HARD] if you want hard mode) using NUPS.

5. Apply the patch. If it doesn't work, re-attempt by making NUPS notify you if the file is invalid. There is a little section for this in the bottom left; hit "notify".

6. Get your ROM and smack it into Visual Boy Advance, preferably v1.8.0 beta, but v1.7.2. should work. Google can help you find this.

7. Enjoy the game!
