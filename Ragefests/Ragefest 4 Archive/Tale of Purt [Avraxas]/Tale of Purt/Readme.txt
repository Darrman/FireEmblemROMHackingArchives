This version is slightly reworked from the original version of Tale of Purt;
this version addresses some inconsistencies, bugs, balance issues, and
adds in some minor easter eggs. As such, this version may not play exactly 
the same way as the original, though the changes should be small.

SAVE STATES
______________
In the Save Files folder, one.rxdata is the suspend 
(autosaves to this file after every action you make,
like in other Fire Emblem games), and two.rxdata
is the file overwritten and loaded when you select
the Savestate option in game.

There are reminders in the game to remind you to
save state, as well as to place points where it would
be best to use the 3 save state maximum.
