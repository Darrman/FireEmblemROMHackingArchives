This folder is a backup of all hacks found in the
Fire Emblem Universe Hack Directory thread.
This backup was created on the 16th of April 2019.
The primary intent of this backup is for hack preservation.
If a file host goes down, any hacks on it go down with it.
All hack filenames had their creators added to them.
Some also received modifications to make it clearer exactly what the hack was.
Arch's FE11 Sync Patch and FE6XNA do not have functional downloads.
All other hacks are sorted into their appropriate folders.
All hacks have what I believe are their current latest versions.
If you do not want a hack you created to be included here,
please contact me and I will remove it.
