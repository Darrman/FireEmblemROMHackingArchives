Please note that the Weapon Triangle has been changed to 3 damage and 15 hit.

Everyone has mounted aid, that's on purpose.
Everyone is level 0, that's on purpose.


The NPCs have a few possible AI settings. They can run towards your units, or Escape towards the door at the upper center of the map. 
If they're going for the door, they do Escape when they get there.

Finally, your current gold should be equal to your accomplishment towards the chapter objective.

Due to the chapter gimmick, it would be unfair for me to not give you an item list:
