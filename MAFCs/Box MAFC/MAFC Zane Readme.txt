When you start the game, the first map is a chance for you to build a team. Talk to the NPCs to pick units. Each class has a specific set of stats and items. You can check the NPCs to see what they start with.

Stats are chosen as follows:
Each unit has three “tagged” stats, let’s call them A, B, and C.
A unit’s A stat is 15.
A unit’s B stat is 12.
A unit’s C stat is 10.
All other stats are 8, except for HP and movement. HP is calculated using the formula Str + Con + (Def + Mag)/2. All units have a movement range of 6.

The lord is a bit different: he’s got 10 for all stats (other than HP and movement) and has the Charm skill. He starts with a Light Brand, Volt Edge, Armorslayer, Paragon Sword, and Master Sword.

You get three male units and one female unit along with the lord.

Here’s a table of classes, their tagged stats, and their inventories:
